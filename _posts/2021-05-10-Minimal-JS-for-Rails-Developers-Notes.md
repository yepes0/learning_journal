# Welcome to my seventh entry

The full reference for key JS concepts for rails developers can be found at this location: https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/861. I have included my notes on the most revelant sections below:

JavaScript was created in 1995 and has become the third standard language of the web, along with HTML (for structure) and CSS (for style). 

- All you need to run a JS document is a .html file.
- All text in JS has to be wrapped in quotes to be valid
- To create a JavaScript file the file should end in ".js"
- We normally use external scripts and reference them in our code:
    <script src="index.js"></script>
- []
- []
