title: Things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
1) You learn interesting things by reading other people’s code and become more informed about what’s going on in the project overall
2) Helps to spread knowledge throughout the team
3) Be friendly when providing feedback as tone is difficult to transmit in text
    - If you see something particularly nice, let the person know, “Hey this is a cool idea.”
    - Diff: the delta shown between the base version and your new commit   
    - If you see lots of green, the coder probably pasted a fair amount of code so it’s probably not as concise as possible
    - Again, try to be over-the-top polite
