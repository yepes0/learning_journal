# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my second Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!

**Today's notes**
I learned several tools to help me navigate the terminal:
cd ~ --> takes me home
cd .. --> gets me up a level
pwd --> means print working directory
ls --> list segments
cd --> change directory

I also spoke with Professor Betina and learned that classes can do everything that modules can do, but modules can only do some of the things that classes can do.
